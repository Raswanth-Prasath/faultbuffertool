description=Create buffers for fault traces based on confidence attributes and ranking criteria.
version=0.1

about=The Fault Buffer Tool allows geologists and engineers to create uncertainty buffers around mapped fault traces based on literature-backed values. The tool supports multiple uncertainty calculation approaches: general uncertainty, uncertainty with ranking (based on confidence, primary/secondary classification, and simple/complex classification), and geologic judgment. It also handles different fault types (strike-slip, normal, reverse) with appropriate symmetric or asymmetric buffers. Developed at Arizona State University.
